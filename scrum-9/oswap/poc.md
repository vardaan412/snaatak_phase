# **Introduction**
This proof of concept (POC) offers a detailed walkthrough for conducting Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) with OWASP ZAP.


# **Pre-requisites**
- Minimum Java-17
- A Running Application(Attendance API Python) to Perform DAST.
> **NOTE:**  
> We are using the Attendance API for this setup.
