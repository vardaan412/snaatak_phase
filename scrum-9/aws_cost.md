# **Introduction**

This document explains how to monitor AWS spending by setting up **Budget and Cost Anomaly Alerts**. It covers the purpose, benefits, and best practices for implementing alerts that help avoid unexpected charges.



# **What Are Budget and Cost Anomaly Alerts?**

- To **stay within budget** and prevent overages
- To **detect billing anomalies** before they become costly
- To **increase visibility** into service-level usage trends
- To **improve financial accountability** in cloud environments
