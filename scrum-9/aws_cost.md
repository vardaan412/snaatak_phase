## Introduction

As cloud usage scales, managing and monitoring costs becomes crucial. AWS Budget and Cost Anomaly Alerts are key services designed to help track and control spending efficiently. This document explains the purpose, workflow, and benefits of these tools, and provides best practices to optimize AWS costs.



## What Are Budget and Cost Anomaly Alerts?

These tools together help organizations monitor financial metrics and take preventive actions to avoid billing surprises.



## Why Use Budget and Cost Anomaly Alerts?

- To **stay within budget** and prevent overages
- To **detect billing anomalies** before they become costly
- To **increase visibility** into service-level usage trends
- To **improve financial accountability** in cloud environments
