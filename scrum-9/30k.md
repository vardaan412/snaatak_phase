# Cloud Infrastructure Design â€“ 30K Feet Overview

## Introduction

This document provides a 30,000-foot overview of the cloud infrastructure designed to support scalable, secure, and efficient DevOps and application environments. It explains the architecture, design rationale, component breakdown, and key system interactions within AWS.

---

## Pre-requisites

Before deploying or reviewing this cloud architecture, ensure you have:

- AWS account with sufficient permissions
- Familiarity with basic AWS services (EC2, VPC, Subnets, IAM)
- Basic knowledge of CI/CD, observability, and cloud networking
- AWS CLI or Management Console access
- SSH key pair configured (for Bastion access)

---

## System Development Approach

The system follows a modular and secure approach:

- VPC Segmentation: Isolated VPCs for Management, Non-Prod, and Prod environments
- Zonal Redundancy: Usage of multiple availability zones to ensure high availability
- Public/Private Subnet Separation: Public access limited to Bastion; all other servers reside in private subnets
- Role-based Components:
  - Jenkins for CI/CD
  - SonarQube for code quality checks
  - Prometheus & Grafana for monitoring and visualization
- Security-First: Access control using Bastion host and IAM roles

## Resource Requirements (High Level)

| Component               | Resource Type | Purpose                                        |
|------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Bastion Host           | EC2 (t2.micro) | Secure entry point to private subnets         |
| Jenkins Server         | EC2 (t3.medium) | CI/CD Pipeline management                     |
| SonarQube Server       | EC2 (t3.large)  | Code analysis and quality metrics             |
| Prometheus & Grafana   | EC2 (t3.medium) | Monitoring and visualization                  |
| App/DB Servers (Prod)  | EC2 (t3.large)  | Application hosting and database operations   |
