## Conclusion  

GitHub is the preferred platform for our OT Microservices project due to its ease of use, cost-effectiveness, and seamless integration with our existing workflows. While GitLab offers similar features, GitHub meets our needs for version control, CI/CD, and project management without requiring additional migration or resources. The overlap in features and our team's familiarity with GitHub make it the best choice for our project.
