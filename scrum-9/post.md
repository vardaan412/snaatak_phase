## Introduction

PostgreSQL is a relational SQL database, which means it stores data in rows and columns. It was developed in 1986 by the University of California, Berkeley. It is widely used by many companies such as Apple, Cisco, Fujitsu, Instagram, Spotify, Skype, etc.
**"Additionally, we are using PostgreSQL in our project for the Attendance API."**

## Conclusion
PostgreSQL is an ideal database for microservices due to its reliability, scalability, and support for complex queries. It helps manage data efficiently across distributed services, ensuring consistency, high performance, and flexibility as the system grows. Its advanced features make it a powerful choice for handling large volumes of data in microservice architectures.
